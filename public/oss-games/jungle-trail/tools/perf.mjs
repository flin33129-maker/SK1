/* What a frame costs, per quality tier, in milliseconds that mean something.
 *
 * The obvious way to measure this — watch the frame counter — cannot work
 * here, because the loop is capped and the browser will happily report sixty
 * for anything that fits in sixteen milliseconds. That hides the whole
 * question. So the loop is paused, frames are driven by hand, and each block
 * is bracketed by glFinish so the CPU actually waits for the GPU instead of
 * timing how fast it can queue work.
 *
 * Timings are the median of seven interleaved blocks rather than one long
 * average. Interleaving matters: the driver's clocks ramp during a run, and a
 * sequential "all of A then all of B" comparison charges the ramp entirely to
 * whichever ran first, which is how a post-processing pass gets blamed for a
 * millisecond that belonged to the GPU waking up.

 * shader over a much larger share of the screen. A regression in either is
 * invisible from the other, so the stop is a flag and both get measured. */

     * frame timings were roughly right, but which for a chain of ten
     * full-screen passes is forty microseconds regardless of what the shaders
     * do. The symptom was that adding post-processing appeared to make the
     * frame faster, and that ultra came out quicker than medium.
